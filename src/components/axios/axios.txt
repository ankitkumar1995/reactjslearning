axios interceptor
axios interceptor are a powerful feature in the axios javascript library that allow us to intercept and modify http request and response before they are handled by the application.
Interceptor commonly used for tasks like add authentication, headers, handling error response, or logging request information. 

In axios, we can define interceptor for both request and response.
Interceptor is a function that takes a configuration object for request or a response object for response.
Interceptor can modify the data or headers of the request/response, or they can handle errors and return custom response.
